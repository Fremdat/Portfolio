# Readme for Covid19

This is an example of a short exploratory data analysis using SQL and Tableau

## Short Summary:

I use two datasets - on covid deaths and vaccines - for a joint exploratory data analysis. Some questions I answer are:

- How likely is it to die from an infection in a certain country?
- What percentage of the population is or was infected?
- Which countries have the highest death count?
- Which percentage of the population is vaccinated? (i.e. create a rolling count)

I visualize some of the information with Tableau

## Files:

- **EDA_Covid_SQL.sql:** SQL Code for EDA
- **covidDeaths.xlsx:** Excel file containing the raw data (1 of 2)
- **covidVaccinations.xlsx:** Excel file containing the raw data (2 of 2)
- **Tableau:** please refer here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oliverfr94/viz/CovidDashboard_16309378210690/Dashboard1
