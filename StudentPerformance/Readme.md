# Readme for StudentPerformance

This is an example of feature engineering and a short exploratory data analysis using Python Jupyter Notebooks

## Short Summary:

I use a dataset on student performance. After a first look at the data and controlling for missing values, I create an average test score for each student and preprocess the categorical variables to make them usable in visualizations.

In the next step, individual distributions are investigated via summary statistics and graphs. 

Finally, a correlation matrix is created and the connection between some categorical variables and other features is looked at in more detail.

## Files:

- **EDA_Studentsperformance.ipynb:** Python Jupyter Notebook containing the code
- **StudentsPerformance.csv:** CSV-File containing the raw data

## Skills used:

- Creating new variables and dummy variables
- Summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, value counts, ..)
- Seaborn: bar charts, density charts, boxplots, heatmap (correlation matrix)
